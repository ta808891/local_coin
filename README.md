# Problem statement:
most of the losers in the ongoing covid19 pandemic are small and local businesses while big business benefit substantially due to the lockdown. Awareness was raised for supporting local businesses but this had little to no effect.

# Idea explanation:
We are creating a Smart Coin in support of Local Economies. Local Chia is a smart coin that can only be spent in a specific geographic area. Since digital currency is generally not restricted to where it can be spent, capital flows to global corporations is a common and frictionless occurrence that leads to a lack of resilience and loss of capital in the local economy. Imagine corporate bars replacing the family-owned neighborhood bar, diversity decreases or worse a corporation deems your location not worthy of having a bar. Since they hold the bulk of the capital, they can make those decisions independent of the individuals. This idea is building off of Kingston's local currency Hudson Current and Nils Elmark's book, A New Local Economy. Chia technology makes sense as the smart contracts reside inside the coin and you can create rules on its use. To disincentivize exchanging for use in other locations, a user must pay an exchange fee to revise the smart coin rules.


Users in a specific location would have access to the coin which is based on the Chia blockchain, the chia blockchain does not make use of proof of stake which makes it eco friendly and fast. The coin would be restricted to a specific geographical zone and would not function outside of that region. Users can use this token to buy from small businesses. Our platform would include a website and a mobile app which would enable the users have a listing of all available locations/shops where the token can be spent.
